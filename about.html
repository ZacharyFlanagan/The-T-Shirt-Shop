          <p>
            This family business was started and thriving before our worst nightmare accord... If you live in Louisiana then you know all to well about hurricane katrina that basically ruined a number of places and as you guessed it one of them was us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not giving up tho on our dream in this business we started to rebuild and slowly we have gained and maintained a steady but slow income of customers. Thats why we decieded to make this website to hopefully get our name more out there.
